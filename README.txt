This code essentially sets up a web server that allows users to upload images to the 'static/uploads' directory via HTTP POST requests. 
It also serves a web page that displays the uploaded images using a Flask-based web application. 
The HTTP server and Flask app run concurrently in separate threads to handle image upload and image display functionalities.
